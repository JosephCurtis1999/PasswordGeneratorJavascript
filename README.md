# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This week I built a password generator by modifying starter code. The purpose of this was to hone javascript skills learned in class

User story

I can randomly generate a password by answering prompts based on a set of a criteria outlined in the code

Acceptance criteria

character length between 8 and 128 can be chosen
can confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
input validated after each prompt
a password that is generated will then match the selected criteria
Password is then displayed on the page

Appearance: the following image shows the website's appearance and functionality
